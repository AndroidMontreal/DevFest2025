      "shortBio": "As a Lead Senior UX Designer at Unity Technologies, I’ve spent the past 4 years designing complex tools for game developers, tackling the challenge of balancing usability with power. This experience has given me deep insight into the challenges and opportunities that UX presents in creative tools.\n\nHaving benefited from mentorship and support programs, I’m passionate about helping underrepresented creators thrive in the tech and gaming industries. By rethinking UX in creative tools, we can build more inclusive environments where everyone has the opportunity to participate, experiment, and innovate - “redefining what’s possible” and making the impossible accessible and achievable.",
